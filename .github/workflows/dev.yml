# GitHub Actions Workflow for Deployment to Development Environment
#
# This workflow automates the deployment of the serverless application to a development environment after testing in a temporary environment.
# It performs the following steps:
# 1. Sets up the required tools (Node.js, Terraform)
# 2. Configures AWS credentials using OIDC for secure authentication
# 3. Creates and deploys infrastructure to a temporary environment using Terraform
# 4. Runs integration and end-to-end tests against the deployed environment
# 5. Destroys the temporary environment after testing
# 6. Deploys to development environment
#
# The workflow can be triggered in two ways:
# - Manually through the GitHub Actions UI (workflow_dispatch)
# - Automatically on push to the main branch
#
# It uses concurrency controls to prevent multiple deployments running simultaneously.
